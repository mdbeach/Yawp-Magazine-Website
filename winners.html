                        and familiar faces,' a tall man said. He was an older man with short, stringy, and graying hair and wrinkles
                        forming across his face. His clothing, which looked ratty yet well-loved, seemed stained with years' worth of
                        oil and grime. The air around him was tainted with the smell of cars and rubber, and his boots looked to be
                        caked in layers of dried mud. Everything about him screamed 'nature-dude'. It was hard to believe that such a
                        nice-looking middle-aged, almost-elderly man would have ever killed someone." (Hooks 1.)</p>

                    <p style="color: #E9E4DC; font-size: medium;">"This country is a horror movie. They taught us how to hide, not how
                        to fight, so I sharpen my voice like a kitchen knife. We don’t live in haunted houses, but houses haunted by the
                        fear of waking up each morning. Because you can’t tell me this movie will end when the end credits haven't
                        rolled. We’re not paranoid, we’re losing control." (Lafferty 1.)</p>

                        breath and hold no yield. Here I lie, breathing and wheezing and gasping for air, and here you are still calling
                        me beautiful. How cruel of you to show me such affections when you have the hands to help.
