                            was asked to write a bio for the website or something, but I'm not sure what to write. I guess I'll just say a
                            little about myself. As of now I'm a Junior, and I'm on my second year of Lit Mag. I enjoy writing, yet I suck at
                            making time to do so. I have a somewhat large amount of different interest. In terms of music, I enjoy Rock and Rap
                            mostly, yet I do enjoy a mixture of other stuff (Anything but Country really). I like to play games and listen to
                            music in my free time, and I'll also probably find time to take a walk or do some kind of physical routine. Favorite
                            games include Oneshot, Silent Hill 2, and Kingdom Hearts 2, though I also have a ton of other picks. I'm sticking
                            around in Lit Mag since I just really like to see what students can write, I think it's a ton of fun reading pieces
                            (even if they are a little rough at times). Anyway though, that's about it. If you're reading this, than good luck
                            with your writing, and please do submit I'd love to see what you got!"</p>
